# Ternary-if....else-

Python Ternary Operator
===========================================================
=>The Ternary Operator in Python is "if..else" Operator.
----------------
=>Syntax:    varname= Expr1  if Test Cond else Expr2
----------------
=>Here 'if' and 'else' are the Key Words
=>Here Test Cond can be either Relational Expression or Logical Expression and whose Result can be either True or 
   False.
=>If the Result of Test Condition is True then PVM Executes Expr1 and whose Result placed in LHS VarName.
=>If the Result of Test Condition is False then PVM goes to else part and Executes Expr2 and whose Result placed in 
    LHS VarName.
=>Hence Python Ternary Operator (if..else) executes either Expr1 OR Expr2 and whose Result placed in LHS Varname.
